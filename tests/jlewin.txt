After a three month break, trying to get back up to speed on this project. The changes made to the build process that allowed for the creation of json output aren't completely clear so I'll try to track my research across a clean rebuild in a fresh env to track down what's really needed.

Command line examples:

    ctest -R dxf --debug

    ctest -R dxf

    ctest -R .*issue54*

    /usr/bin/python /home/jlewin/repo/openscad/tests/init.py

    /usr/bin/python ../collect_results.py . jlewin.txt

    /home/jlewin/repo/openscad/tests/build/openscad_nogui /home/jlewin/repo/openscad/tests/../testdata/scad/bugs/issue578.scad -o /home/jlewin/repo/openscad/tests/build/opencsgtest-output/issue578-actual.png


Rebuild:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    /usr/bin/python /home/jlewin/repo/openscad/tests/init.py
    make
    ctest -R dxf
